## Downloads

To follow along with the workshop, you will require both R (the programming language) and RStudio (the IDE):

- R - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
- RStudio - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Once both are installed, open RStudio and run the following package installations within the console:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
