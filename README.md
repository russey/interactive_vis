Welcome to the Interactive Visualisation workshop presented at the RSS International Conference 2021. If you would like to follow along with the workshop or explore the examples afterwards, you will require the installations listed below.

## Requirements

To follow along with the workshop, you will require both R (the programming language) and RStudio (the IDE):

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Once both are installed, open RStudio and run the following package installations within the console:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
